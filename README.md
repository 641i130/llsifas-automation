The primary goal of this project is to generate thumbnails of each model in the game after a simple ADB import of the assets. Nothing besides accepting the file transfer from the phone should be inputted by the user. Everything else should be using other tools like blender, klbvfs and UnityPy to handle the rest of the functions.

# Current progress
- Getting files to decrypt
- Getting the decrypted files into a script-able blender format
- Rendering and exporting the Blender files
